======

## Project
The objective for this project is to create a functional piano.

## Technology
* Atom Text Editor
* Webpack
* HTML5 Canvas
* ES2015 Javascript
* Command Line Interface
* Git/Github

## Learning Experience
This project is currently in progress. Working with HTML5 Canvas, I used Javascript and piano audio to make a piano that users can play with their keyboard. After working with Javascript extensively during my App Development program, I've refactored my files so that they use fewer lines of code.
